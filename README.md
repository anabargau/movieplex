# Movieplex

This is the first CRUD app that I have done by myself using Express, the NodeJS framework, and the MVC architectural pattern. It is a simple movie library in which you can add, delete and update movies and movie genres. I have deepened my knowledge of how to use express, express validator and how to think and implement my routes and how to structure my app the best. I also used mongoDB as the database.

First, you can start by adding the movie genres.

Then, you can start adding your favorite movies and assign it to a genre.

On the home screen, you can see your movies sorted by rating in the top rated section.
